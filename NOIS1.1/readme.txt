Windows NOIS version 1.1

This application will be installed into its own directory. You may use this version on
Forum or any account where v1.1 has been installed. You should not run this v1.1
executable for any v1.0 server account.

To use this program on your pc, you will need to be a valid user of NOIS on Forum,
install this software on a Windows 95, 98 or NT computer that has a network connection
to Forum. If you can use a telenet application from your PC to Forum, then this should work.


You should have a hosts file in you Windows directory (for Windows 95) or
Winnt\System32\Drivers\Etc (for NT). You need to edit the hosts file to include:

152.128.1.25         forumserver

Note: If you do not have a hosts file, you can copy the hosts file sent with this
application to your Windows directory.

That's it. If your PC is connected to the VA's network then you just double click the 
nois.exe and you should be able to log on to NOIS on Forum.

Use of Windows NOIS is monitored on Forum. The date/time of signon, the user, and the
software version number are recorded. This information is used to monitor users using
old versions that may need to be updated. Also a count is made on which remote procedure
calls are being used (similar to alpha/beta option counting). This is used to see which 
parts of the software are being used.

Please refer to the online help for a tour of the software features.
