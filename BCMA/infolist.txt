INSTALLATION PROCESS
====================
XWB*1*29 MUST BE INSTALLED ON EACH PC!
The Broker Development kit IS NOT required for BCMA.  The
Broker Development Kit does not have to be installed on any
client PC.  However, XWB*1*29 IS REQUIRED on each PC

Run BCMA setup program. The wizard will guide you through 
installation process. This can be used as a fresh
installation, or can be used to upgrade an existing
version of BCMA.  If you wish to use multiple versions
of BCMA, please install into an alternate directory,
otherwise accept the default directory to overwrite your
existing installation, if one exists.

There are three types of installation:
- TYPICAL will install the main BCMA application only.
- FULL will install the main BCMA application as well
as the Site Parameters definition program.
- CUSTOM will allow you to select which programs to install. 

If you are not an experienced user, we suggest selecting
defaults for each option presented during setup.
