Quick GUI_Config installation instructions by Ignacio H. Valdes, MD, MS. GUI_Config program by 
Kevin Toppenberg, MD

To install the client on Windows:

1) Drag the GUI_Config folder out of the GUI_config.zip folder to the Desktop or use an unzip program.
2) Double click GUI_Config folder to open it.
3) Right click GUI_Config.exe-->Send to-->Desktop (create shortcut)
4) Right click 'Shortcut to GUI_Config'-->Properties. In the Target field 
   go to the end of the text and past the last " add S=??? P=??? where S is the IP
   address of your WorldVistA server and P is the port number.


If you have not installed the KID server patch, open the GUI_Config folder then open 
   the KIDS Server patch folder. The TMG_GUI_CONFIG-1-2.kid is the patch file. There are 
   instructions on how to install it in TMG_GUI_CONFIG-1-1.txt but it assumes you know how
   to get to the KIDS patching menu items. Beginners who do not know how it is done at all
   take note:

In general, KIDs patches on a Linux server are done as follows: 
1)	Obtain the KIDs patch and place it into a directory on the server where you know 
        it is and that the id running VistA can get to it. In our example, the id that 
        runs VistA is vista, so a good place to put it for access later is /home/vista.
2)      Remove possible Microsoft formatting for CR and LF by doing the following at a bash prompt: 
        \home\vista\: zip TMG_GUI_CONFIG-1-2.zip TMG_GUI_CONFIG-1-2.kid
        \home\vista\: unzip -a TMG_GUI_CONFIG-1-2.zip
        This will change any Microsoft carriage return/line feeds to proper Unix format.
2)	Get to the gtm prompt, get into the system in programmer mode via S DUZ=whatever id D ^XUP 
3)	Navigate through the system by going to to: EVE -> Prog -> KIDS -> Install 
4)	Choose option 1 Load a Distribution.
5)	Enter the fully qualified path such as /home/vista/TMG-GUI-CONFIG-1-2.kid 
6)      Before you choose option 6 install, have TMG_GUI_CONFIG-1-1.txt open and available
        to answer some of the questions it will ask.
7)	Choose option 6 Install Packages and enter TMG and it should install.
