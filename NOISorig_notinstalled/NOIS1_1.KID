"KRN",9.2,924,1,4,0)
NOIS is intended to be used as a central database where all ISCs log calls
"KRN",9.2,924,1,5,0)
on the same system.
"KRN",9.2,924,1,6,0)
Calls are not owned by any single user.  Any NOIS call can be opened,
"KRN",9.2,924,1,7,0)
edited, or closed by anyone having the authority to edit a call.
"KRN",9.2,924,1,8,0)
List Manager is the primary user interface to display lists of calls and
"KRN",9.2,924,1,9,0)
call information.
"KRN",9.2,924,1,10,0)
You can define a criteria for the calls that you normally deal with.
"KRN",9.2,924,1,11,0)
Virtually any type of call can be searched for.
"KRN",9.2,924,1,12,0)
Browsing information on calls is made easy by using ad hoc displays.
"KRN",9.2,924,1,13,0)
Notifications can be made using MailMan or menu alerts.  You can be
"KRN",9.2,924,1,14,0)
notified automatically of changes to calls you are interested in.  Sites
"KRN",9.2,924,1,15,0)
can also be notified automatically.
"KRN",9.2,924,1,16,0)
NOIS data can be easily extracted to PC applications and spreadsheets.

                            Getting Started
"KRN",9.2,925,1,2,0)
Logging calls in NOIS is about the same as before.  You enter a
"KRN",9.2,925,1,3,0)
description of the problem and a resolution, along with a few fields to
"KRN",9.2,925,1,4,0)
identify who called and when.  Logging calls still uses prompts for the
"KRN",9.2,925,1,5,0)
fields to enter and the editor youve chosen when working with FileMan word
"KRN",9.2,925,1,6,0)
processing fields.
"KRN",9.2,925,1,7,0)
List Manager is used for finding, reviewing, and editing calls.  If you're
"KRN",9.2,925,1,8,0)
not familiar with using List Managers scroll region and XQORs menus, refer
"KRN",9.2,925,1,9,0)
to several DHCP applications that are using this interface (scheduling,
"KRN",9.2,925,1,10,0)
discharge summary, etc.).
"KRN",9.2,925,1,11,0)
To learn to use NOIS, look at the examples in the Tour Guide, or just jump
"KRN",9.2,925,1,12,0)
in, log some calls, browse around, and find some interesting calls.  Every
"KRN",9.2,925,1,13,0)
NOIS function (except for setting up files) can be done using the List
"KRN",9.2,925,1,14,0)
Calls option.
"KRN",9.2,925,1,15,0)
Before you jump in, you may want to try a usability test on the software.
"KRN",9.2,925,1,16,0)
A usability test tests how intuitive the software is to use (its not a
"KRN",9.2,925,1,17,0)
test of the user).  Usually the test involves observing the user perform
"KRN",9.2,925,1,18,0)
tasks - but since we cant do that on everyone, test the software and give
"KRN",9.2,925,1,19,0)
us your opinions.

There are two fields that determine a status for a call.  There is a field

for support status and a field for development status.  When making status
"KRN",9.2,931,1,4,0)
changes, only a single status is entered (the two fields are filled in

"KRN",9.2,931,1,6,0)
specific for support or development.
"KRN",9.2,931,1,7,0)
A support status can be open, refer to dev, vendor, closed, or canceled.
"KRN",9.2,931,1,8,0)
A development status can be open, awaiting patch, next release, future

"KRN",9.2,935,1,2,0)
 
"KRN",9.2,935,1,3,0)
List Manager provides applications a means of scrolling documents or lists
"KRN",9.2,935,1,4,0)
of items.  Items can be selected from the list by using the available
"KRN",9.2,935,1,5,0)
actions at the bottom of the screen.  Note: this is not always intuitive -
"KRN",9.2,935,1,6,0)
with List Manager, you select the action, then you select the item.
"KRN",9.2,935,1,7,0)
 
"KRN",9.2,935,1,8,0)
Documentation on List Manager is found in PIMS documentation.
"KRN",9.2,935,1,9,0)
The actions are protocols (XQOR) that are used as menus or items that run
"KRN",9.2,935,1,10,0)
programs.  The advantage is that records can be displayed and several
"KRN",9.2,935,1,11,0)
actions are available to perform without having to navigate through
"KRN",9.2,935,1,12,0)
several options (where each time you would have to select the record

again).
"KRN",9.2,935,1,14,0)
 
"KRN",9.2,935,1,15,0)
List Manager provides a hidden menu of actions that are also available to
"KRN",9.2,935,1,16,0)
use.  NOIS uses the hidden menu to contain actions that can generally be
"KRN",9.2,935,1,17,0)
done on any display.  These actions include actions for scrolling the
"KRN",9.2,935,1,18,0)
screen or to go to a specific page of the display.
"KRN",9.2,935,1,19,0)

Temporary
"KRN",9.2,939,1,6,0)
When you browse calls or receive notifications, notice that the title of
"KRN",9.2,939,1,7,0)
the list is Temporary List.  This list is not defined, nor are calls
"KRN",9.2,939,1,8,0)
stored on this list.  When you leave this list the calls are not saved.
"KRN",9.2,939,1,9,0)
 
"KRN",9.2,939,1,10,0)
Storage Only
"KRN",9.2,939,1,11,0)
These lists simply hold calls.  Calls must be added manually to these
"KRN",9.2,939,1,12,0)
lists, and manually deleted.  They are like mail baskets - you have to
"KRN",9.2,939,1,13,0)
maintain them.  These lists can be owned or be public.  Any specialist can
"KRN",9.2,939,1,14,0)
create storage only lists.
"KRN",9.2,939,1,15,0)
 
"KRN",9.2,939,1,16,0)
Indexed
"KRN",9.2,939,1,17,0)
Indexed lists are part of the NOIS software.  You cant create them or
"KRN",9.2,939,1,18,0)
delete them.  Calls are not stored with these lists.  The list simply uses
"KRN",9.2,939,1,19,0)
a cross reference in the call file to access these calls.  They are fast
"KRN",9.2,939,1,20,0)
to access and automatically maintained.  Compound cross references require
"KRN",9.2,939,1,21,0)
that you enter a value.  For example, Open Calls by Site would require
"KRN",9.2,939,1,22,0)
entering the site.

"KRN",9.2,939,1,24,0)
Active Update
"KRN",9.2,939,1,25,0)
Specialists can define a list for a specific criteria.  An active update
"KRN",9.2,939,1,26,0)
list uses a query as the definition of what calls should be on the list.
"KRN",9.2,939,1,27,0)
The query is the same syntax as when searching for calls.  These lists are
"KRN",9.2,939,1,28,0)
maintained whenever someone edits a call.  When a call is edited, it is
"KRN",9.2,939,1,29,0)
reviewed by every active update criteria as to whether the call will be
"KRN",9.2,939,1,30,0)
included or removed from the list (fortunately all this updating is going
"KRN",9.2,939,1,31,0)
on in the background).  Notification can also be used with these lists.
"KRN",9.2,939,1,32,0)
Notification using lists requires that the lists be owned.

List action.  Any time you change to a list, the list is rebuilt.  This is
"KRN",9.2,941,1,8,0)
of interest when you are using a list and edit the list.  Perhaps your
"KRN",9.2,941,1,9,0)
list only has open calls and you close a call.  When you return to the

list of NOIS calls the call still appears on the list.  If you go back to

an option and enter the list, the call would now not be on the list

"KRN",9.2,943,1,7,0)
You can sort by any field value that is searchable (except for word

"KRN",9.2,943,1,9,0)
The sorted output is by the field value and not the display value.

Obviously dates appear in time order, but other fields may sometimes only

"KRN",9.2,943,1,13,0)
Up to five fields can be used in a sort.
"KRN",9.2,943,1,14,0)
Any field may be selected to be in descending order (ascending order is

"KRN",9.2,945,1,4,0)
Queries provide a way for finding calls that meet a certain criteria.
"KRN",9.2,945,1,5,0)
The calls found can be added to the list or removed from list.
"KRN",9.2,945,1,6,0)
Select means that those calls on the list meeting the criteria will remain
"KRN",9.2,945,1,7,0)
on the list and those not are removed.
"KRN",9.2,945,1,8,0)
Entering a criteria involves selecting the field (attribute), condition,
"KRN",9.2,945,1,9,0)
and value.  This is similar to FileMans search.
"KRN",9.2,945,1,10,0)
The selections for the condition and value depend on the field.  For
"KRN",9.2,945,1,11,0)
example, pointer type fields do not allow a contains or greater than
"KRN",9.2,945,1,12,0)
condition.  Word-processing fields do not allow an equal condition.  The
"KRN",9.2,945,1,13,0)
exists and not exits conditions (null, not null) do not prompt for values.
"KRN",9.2,945,1,14,0)
 The between condition uses two values and only applies to number or date
"KRN",9.2,945,1,15,0)
fields.  Entering question marks for help will show the available
"KRN",9.2,945,1,16,0)
selections.
"KRN",9.2,945,1,17,0)
The criteria can be continued using an and or or.  Multiple operations of

"KRN",9.2,945,1,19,0)
of interest.

Notifying using mail allows you to send a message and/or load the list
"KRN",9.2,969,1,4,0)
into the message.  You can thus send several calls in the same mail
"KRN",9.2,969,1,5,0)

"KRN",9.2,969,1,7,0)
it.
"KRN",9.2,969,1,8,0)
Mail uses an email address that can be a remote domain, so that you can

"KRN",9.2,969,1,14,0)
You can optionally include any calls on your current list.  This allows
"KRN",9.2,969,1,15,0)

specialist, package, and support status.
"KRN",9.2,984,1,17,0)
7.  Switch format to Detailed.
