SFVAMC Changes:

 * Changed the version number to 2.1.2.  Change was made in the VersionInfo resource and the version label in the "About" box.

 * Replaced the TRPCBroker component with the TSharedRPCBroker component.  Commented out the startup of the CLAGENT.EXE program.  This is no longer used by the TSharedRPCBroker component.

 * Compiled with the latest version (11-17-2002) of the ICS components (http://overbyte.delphicenter.com/frame_index.html).  The distribution used to compile GUIMail is included in the ..\ics\ics.zip file.  Needed to change the TMimeDecode.PartLine method in mail.pas to be compatible with the new ICS changes.

 * Added a Terminate Message button.

 * Added Screen.Cursor and, in some cases, Try/Finally code to the following procedures in mailinterface.pas.
     ForwardMail
     LstCallRPC
     MessageSearch
     SendMessageText
     SendMessageTextMax
     SetUserPreferences

 * Corrected a message sorting problem in the UpdateListView procedure in mail.pas by adding a call to lv.resort.

 * Enable/disabled the Delete, Terminate, and Print buttons when no message(s) is selected.

 * Changed the TFMLister.Screen value.  Concatenated in the value of XMDUZ rather than trying to use the XMDUZ variable that might or might not exist on the server.

 * When scrolling up/down through the messages using the keyboard arrow keys, one key press would cause a skip of two messages.  This has been corrected.

 * Update the "new mail" icon in the system tray on the following events:
     New Mail button clicked
     Delete button clicked
     Terminate button clicked
     Make New button clicked
     Message is read
     Message(s) moved to another mail basket (e.g., the WASTE basket)
     Mail basket is purged or deleted

 * The column headers in Message Properties -> Recipient List sometimes would not display correctly, this has been corrected.

 * Replaced 'New Messages' and 'Message Search Results' string references with TXT_NEWMESSAGES and TXT_SEARCHRESULTS constants.

 * Display the basket that contains the currently selected mail message when viewing 'New Messages' and 'Message Search Results', e.g., 'New Messages (Selected Message in XYZ Basket)'.

 * Display new and priority message subjects in bold.

 * Added "2003" to the copyright list in the "About" box.

 * Added a label to the "About" box with the caption "Enhancements by San Francisco VAMC".

 * Created a resource file cairologo.res that contains the cairo_logo.bmp and sfvamc_logo.bmp files.  Added {$R CAIROLOGO.RES} to the interface section of the GUIMail.pas component unit.  Added the display of the Cario logo to the GUIMail splash screen, the main GUIMail form, and the GUIMail "About" box.  The SFVAMC logo is displayed on the splash screen and in the "About" box.  (Did not put it on the main form due to space considerations.)  All logo images are loaded from the resource.
